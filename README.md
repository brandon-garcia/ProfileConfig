# ProfileConfig
A portable container housing my profile configuration files, namely those dealing with git, vim, and bash. Also houses a colection of simple utility bash scripts as well as source-code-pro. I also recommend diff-so-fancy which I use as my git diff processor.

There are numerous dependencies that I have not covered but likely will
at some point.

Installation:
- After cloning, rename this folder '.profile_config'
- run 'bin/pinstall'
- logout and then log back in or if using cygwin, restart cygwin.
