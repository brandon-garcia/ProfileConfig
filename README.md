# ProfileConfig
A portable container housing my profile configuration files, namely those dealing with git, vim, and bash. Also houses a colection of simple utility bash scripts. I also recommend diff-so-fancy which I use as my git diff processor.

There are numerous dependencies that I have not documented but likely will
at some point.

Installation:
- run 'install' located in the ProfileConfig (or whatever it was named) directory
